<h2>Portable.But Powerful</h2>

<div>

     <p>A fire can start anywhere, at anytime. And in just 6 minutes, it can turn into an uncontrollable blaze. This makes it even more
important for you to tackle the fire, before it’s too late.</p>

     <p>Unfortunately, tiny lanes, inaccessible roads and traffic jams all are a setback when it comes to rushing to the rescue. Which
means that by the time the fire engine reaches the scene of the fire, it could very possibly already be too late.</p>

    <p>The need of the hour is a fire engine that can manoeuvre any road, zip through traffic and reach the burning premises in
minutes.</p>

<p>Ceasefire introduces a state-of-the-art extinguisher on wheels – The Mobile Firefighter. Powered by the world’s most
revolutionary firefighting technology: Watermist.</p>
</div>

<h2>Watermist Technology and How it Works</h2>

<div>

    <p>Ceasefire’s patented Watermist technology uses the world’s oldest, most effective fire suppressant – water, increasing its
power many times over.</p>

    <p>Here’s how. Ceasefire extinguishers equipped with Watermist break water down into a fine mist. This mist is then thrown at the,
fire with a great kinetic force, covering a large surface area. As soon as the mist comes in contact with the fire, it instantly turns
into steam. Enveloping the flames, cutting down the oxygen supply and reducing the temperature to below combustion levels.
Ensuring that even the largest fire succumbs to Watermist technology. In minutes.</p>

<h2>The Power of the Ceasefire Mobile Firefighter</h2>

<div>

     <p>With Ceasefire’s Mobile Firefighter on your side, you can arrive at the scene of the fire in minutes, and keep even the largest
fires under control until the fire engines and more help arrives. These unique 9 litre extinguishers, with an extendable hose, can
be mounted onto almost any bike.</p>

     <p>To add to its firefighting capabilities, two spare containers are also attached. Increasing the power of this firefighter by four!</p>
